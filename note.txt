		2. Custom CSS (Style.css) always writen after the botstrapp CSS
		3. Media.css always lower of serial,such type of CSS run based on screen.

		for developing time we should use botstrap.css(understandable, line by line css) but after delivery to customer(delete botstrap.css file0, we must to enable botstrap.min.css file(this file writen css in single line)
